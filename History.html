<p>Fix your damn machines by the way, Taylor. Your ice cream machines are broken.</p>

<p>Dairy Queen also claimed to have invented soft-serve, in 1934 when J.F. McCullough and his son, Alex developed the formula</p>
<p>near Illinois, and during a trial sale, gave out more than 1600 servings, or more than one every 4.5 seconds.</p>
